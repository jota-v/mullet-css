Just a little help for your style!

## What the heck is this?
Inspired by the [mullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullet_haircut), 80's hottest hairstyle.

Mullet is not a UI framework (but can work together with one), it's just a tiny set of very useful CSS utilities. It can help you speed up some of the styling process with some basic layout, typography, transfoms, performance and accesibility helpers.

As an extra it has a small basic CSS reset, it's not a subsitute for nomalize, if not an extra layer you can use on top of it.

<!-- ## Installation

```bash
$ npm install mulletcss --save
